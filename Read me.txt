1. how to config backend for keras:
  1). find keras.json
  	import os
	print(os.path.expanduser('~'))
	under the directory, find ".keras", in this directory, there is the 'keras.json' file
  2). modify
  	it looks like this:
  	{
    "image_dim_ordering": "tf", 
    "epsilon": 1e-07, 
    "floatx": "float32", 
    "backend": "theano"
	}
	change the "backend" to what you are working with, "theano"/"tensorflow"
